Additionally, geographical features like `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` also have very low p-values, suggesting their significant impact on property prices.\n\nBy identifying the significant features through statistical tests, we can prioritize them when building predictive models.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Statistical tests table\nanova_results = []\nnum_corr_results = []\nfor col in df.columns:\n    if df[col].dtype == 'object':\n        if df[col].nunique() > 1:\n            grouped = df[[col, 'TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)']].dropna().groupby(col)\n            if len(grouped) > 1:\n                f_val, p_val = stats.f_oneway(*(grouped['TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)'].apply(list)))\n                anova_results.append({'Feature': col, 'Test': 'ANOVA', 'P-Value': p_val})\n    elif pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[col]) and col != 'TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)':\n        pearson = stats.pearsonr(df[col], df['TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)'])[1]\n        spearman = stats.spearmanr(df[col], df['TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)'])[1]\n        num_corr_results.append({'Feature': col, 'Test': 'Pearson', 'P-Value': pearson})\n        num_corr_results.append({'Feature': col, 'Test': 'Spearman', 'P-Value': spearman})\n\nstats_df = pd.DataFrame(anova_results + num_corr_results)\nprint(\"\\nStatistical Test Results:\")\nprint(stats_df.sort_values(\"P-Value\").head(10))\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-07T12:28:03.463374Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-07T12:28:03.463823Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-07T12:28:03.590229Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-07T12:28:03.463785Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-07T12:28:03.589132Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature/Target Split\n\nIn this step, we separate the features (input variables) and the target (output variable) that we aim to predict. \n\n1. **Target Variable**:\n   - The target variable is the column `TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)`, which represents the property prices in the dataset.\n   - This is the variable we want to predict using the features (input variables).\n\n2. **Feature Variables**:\n   - All other columns except for `TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)` are considered feature variables.\n   - These are the independent variables that will be used to train machine learning models to predict the target.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Feature/target split\ntarget = \"TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)\"\nX = df.drop(columns=[\"TARGET(PRICE_IN_LACS)\"])\ny = df[target]\nprint(\"X shape:\", X.shape)\nprint(\"y shape:\", y.shape)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-07T12:28:17.494619Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-07T12:28:17.495030Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-07T12:28:17.504806Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-07T12:28:17.494998Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-07T12:28:17.503680Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Train-Test Split\n\nIn this step, we split the dataset into training and testing sets.

This replaces any missing values in numerical columns with the median value of that column. The median is chosen as it is robust to outliers.\n   - **Scaling**: After imputation, we apply the `RobustScaler` to scale the numerical features. This scaler is less sensitive to outliers and scales the features based on the interquartile range (IQR), making it suitable for features with skewed distributions.\n\n2. **Categorical Features**:\n   - **Imputation**: For categorical columns with missing values, we use `SimpleImputer` with the strategy set to `'constant'` and the `fill_value` set to `'missing'`. This ensures that missing categorical values are filled with the string `'missing'`.\n   - **Encoding**: After imputation, we apply `OneHotEncoder` to transform categorical features into a binary matrix.

This handles the imputation, scaling, and encoding of the features in the dataset.\n- **RandomForestRegressor**: We use a `RandomForestRegressor`, which is an ensemble model that combines the predictions of many decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. We set a `random_state` for reproducibility.\n\n### 2. **Cross-Validation**:\n- We use **cross-validation (CV)** to evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation splits the training data into multiple subsets and trains the model on each subset while testing on the remaining data. The results are averaged to give a more robust estimate of the model's performance.\n- The evaluation metric we use is the **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**, as it is a common metric for regression tasks. The negative sign is used because `cross_val_score` returns scores, and we want to minimize the RMSE.\n\n### 3. **Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV**:\n- **GridSearchCV** is used to perform an exhaustive search over a range of hyperparameters for the `RandomForestRegressor`.\n- We specify a set of hyperparameters to tune:\n  - **n_estimators**: The number of trees in the forest. We try different values from 25 to 100.\n  - **max_depth**: The maximum depth of the trees. We explore values from 10 to 50.\n- `GridSearchCV` will try all combinations of these hyperparameters and find the best set based on cross-validation performance.\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Cross-Validation** ensures the model is not overfitting or underfitting by evaluating it on multiple subsets of the data.\n- **Hyperparameter tuning** optimizes the model’s parameters for the best performance.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"model = Pipeline([\n    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),\n    ('regressor', RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42))\n])\n\nprint(model)\n\ncv_rmse_scores = -cross_val_score(model, X_train, y_train, cv=5, scoring='neg_root_mean_squared_error', n_jobs=-1)\nprint(\"CV RMSE scores:\", cv_rmse_scores)\n\nparams = {\n    \"regressor__n_estimators\": range(25, 100, 25),\n    \"regressor__max_depth\": range(10, 50, 10)\n}\n\ngs_model = GridSearchCV(\n    model,\n    param_grid=params,\n    cv=5,\n    n_jobs=-1,\n    verbose=1,\n    scoring='neg_root_mean_squared_error'\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-07T12:29:22.356191Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-07T12:29:22.356534Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-07T12:31:48.135967Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-07T12:29:22.356509Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-07T12:31:48.134696Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Model Training and Results\n\nIn this section, we train the model using **GridSearchCV** and evaluate the results.\n\n### 1. **Model Fitting**:\n- We train the model on the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`) by fitting the `GridSearchCV` model.
